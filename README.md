# RNN-Powered-Trading-Agent-using-PPO
An end-to-end project that trains, evaluates, and visualizes RL trading agents which use RNNs (LSTM / GRU) or MLPs as market-state encoders. Includes an ablation study (LSTM vs GRU vs MLP), a production-grade LSTM agent trained with PPO, and a Streamlit GUI to load models, backtest and generate live signals.
